Hi, and welcome to my personal webpage!

I am a clinical researcher with a background in sport science and physiotherapy with a great interest in hip/groin and hamstring injuries, and data analytics.

I serve as the Head of Sport and Data Science in Football Club Nordsjælland, a Danish premier league football club with associated youth academies in Denmark and Ghana (rated as one of the world’s best academies according to Scouted Football), where I focus on structured data collection and associated analyses to support desicion-making processes. As part of this position, I have developed Power Apps for streamlined data collection, Power BI and R Shiny Dashboards for reporting, and also been involved in developing an SQL database.

I also work as postdoctoral researcher at the Sports Orthopedic Research Center - Copenhagen (SORC-C) at Hvidovre Hospital; an International Olympic Committee (IOC) research center centered around prevention, diagnostics and treatment of musculoskeletal problems.

I completed my PhD in 2022 at SORC-C entitled “Femoroacetabular Impingement Syndrome: Patient Acceptable Symptom State, Return t Sport, and Hip Muscle Strength After Hip Arthroscopy”.
